## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Filter suggestions by category
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
- Upvote product feedback requests
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - For Realtime Database
- Typescript
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was mainly a practice of my knowledge.
In it I learned more about using Typescript with a React project.
and I also get familiar with using an Api context to retrieve data from Firebase.
I have took the proper time to define all the typescript interfaces and develop a well structure for the project and the Api.


### Continued development

I will like to add the capacity for register an user in the future.
